## 💡 Recommendations
Actionable steps NovaRetail can take based on the findings:
- **Replicate the September playbook:** Conduct a retroactive campaign analysis for September (promotions, stock levels, and channel mix) and replicate the most successful tactics.
- **Invest in Lagos and Abuja market penetration:** Lagos contributes ~31.5% of total revenue — prioritize marketing and inventory there. Abuja shows strong accessories volume, so focus on targeted promotions for that category.
- **Focus on retention programs:** Returning customers generate ~59% of revenue. Implement loyalty programs, repeat-purchase incentives, and personalized offers to increase customer lifetime value.
- **Leverage top sales reps:** Analyze Abdul Salim’s performance strategies (accounts, leads, pricing, negotiation) and share best practices through mentorship or adjusted commission structures. Introduce incentives for mid-tier sales reps.
- **Optimize discount strategy:** The average discount per transaction (₦3,248) and total discount (₦357,300) are reasonable. Monitor margin impact during promotional months and favor targeted couponing over blanket discounts.
- **Prioritize high-margin inventory:** Since electronics drive the highest revenue per unit, ensure consistent stock availability, offer warranty bundles, and promote premium service add-ons.
- **Encourage repeat purchases among one-time buyers:** Convert one-time customers (~70% of total) using follow-up offers, cross-sell campaigns, and small loyalty rewards.
- **Investigate Port Harcourt performance:** Since excluding Port Harcourt significantly impacts total revenue, review operations, returns, and delivery times in that city to optimize logistics and marketing spend.
